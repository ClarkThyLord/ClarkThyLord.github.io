        <h3>Guild Smash:</h3> Guild Smashes are games the guild host to let its members target and achieve something greater. Each season the guild will be hosting games, not for bragging rights; but to see where one can improve. As well for those who don't need to improve at all but still reflect on what could've been better. But overall it's to have fun.
