          “When you do something you love it’s not work anymore it’s passion”, said someone, and I do believe that saying; because this isn’t my job, it’s my passion. Passion is nothing more then deep love for something; so in other words, I do the things I’m passionate about, like programming, and try to avoid the things I’m not passionate about.

          When and why did it all start?

        <span class="text">

          All these things I do are thanks to the inspiration that drives me. That inspiration can be traced back to when I was a young boy playing Kingdom Hearts, a video game series. I was fortunate enough to have played it at a very young age, which allowed it to shape who I’m today, that game, if not the feelings that come with that game, is all the power I need to move towards my goal of a better tomorrow.

          When I was around twelve years old I set a goal to develop a video game by the end of a summer vacation, and so I did… not. Turns out developing a video game when you have no experience in algebra, graphic design, computer science, or anything other than watching youtube videos is very hard. Nevertheless, I never gave up, and doing the one thing I was proficient at, watching youtube videos, I learned everything and anything I could. Soon minutes became hours, hours became days, days became weeks, weeks became months, months became years; and before I knew it I was able to develop video games and soo much more! The key is to never give up.

          Something I believe everyone should know?

        </span>

        <hr>

        <span class="text">

          I believe that everyone should know that they're capable of anything, because in this world everything and anything is possible. Obiviusly in a world where everything is possible limits can also be, but so is the possiblity to break those limits. Sure, it may take days, months, years or even lifetimes to break those limits but it’s possible; just as long as you keep the following in mind:
          <ul>
            <li>“Knowledge is power; power is knowledge”</li>
            <li>“Failure is okay; as long as you learn from those failures”</li>
            <li>“We’re all imperfect; but together we can achieve perfection”</li>
          </ul>
