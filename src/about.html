                    “When you do something you love it’s not work anymore it’s passion”, said someone, and I do believe that saying; because this isn’t a job for me this is my passion. And passion is nothing more then love for something, so in other words I do love. :3

                    I got into programming, and all these other things, because of the Kingdom Hearts series; if you aren’t familiar with it I recommend you look into it. Since I played it at a very young age it formed who I am today, being able to shape the future is an amazing thing, so I wanna do that for the future generations.

                    When I was around eleven or twelve I set out a goal to program a video game by the end of the summer vacation, and so I did… not. Turns out creating a video game when you have no experience in algebra, design, computer science, or anything other than watching youtube videos is very hard. Nevertheless, I never gave up, and using the one thing I was able to do, watch youtube videos, I learned everything and anything I could. Minutes became hours, hours became days, days became weeks, weeks became months, months became years and by then I was able to develop video games left and right; of course, not the prettiest of games but they were both fun to play and develop!

                    I believe that we’re capable of anything, because in this world everything and anything is possible. Of course that means even limits can exist in a world where everything is possible, but just as limits are possible so is the ability to break those limits. And sure it may take days, months, years or even lifetimes to break those limits but it’s possible; just as long as you keep the following in mind:
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Knowledge is power; power is knowledge”</li>
                        <li>“Failure is okay; as long as you learn from those failures”</li>
                        <li>“We’re all imperfect; but together we can achieve perfection”</li>
                    </ul>
