                Hi, I’m Christian Cuevas, a Mexican-American full stack developer, I’ve been coding and honing my skills
                since I was 12 years old, that’s over {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2012 }} years of experience!
                Throughout the years I’ve had various opportunities to work on both personal and group projects. While
                I’ve mainly been focused on web and game development, I’ve also had the privilege to work on other
                projects as I’m eager and happy to diversify my skill set.
            </p>
